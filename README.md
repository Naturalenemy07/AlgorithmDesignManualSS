# AlgorithmDesignManualSS

Going through **The Algorithm Design Manual** by *Steven S. Skiena* 3rd Edition.  There is also a lot of HackerRank to brush up on my C++ and learn some new things about C++ and Python. The exercises have LeetCode and HackerRank along with traditional exercises at the end of each chapter.  This repository contains my HackerRank, LeetCode and book exercises.
